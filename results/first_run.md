# ðŸ§Š Benchmark Report: First Run with SQL Queries

This file contains the results of the first query run as part of the FireScale benchmark. This primarily
relates to performance of cold reads over the network, the first time data is accessed.

The following sections contain each benchmark query, execution times across configurations, and rankings.
ðŸ¥‡ = Fastest configuration, ðŸ¥ˆ = 2nd fastest, ðŸ¥‰ = 3rd fastest
